## Request/Response Examples

### Create an Expense

**POST** `/api/expenses`

```json
{
  "description": "Grocery shopping",
  "amount": 85.50,
  "expenseDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "description": "Grocery shopping",
  "amount": 85.50,
  "expenseDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00"
}
```

### Get All Expenses

**GET** `/api/expenses`

**Response (empty database):**

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a **Layered Architecture** pattern:

1. **Presentation Layer** (`controller/`) - Handles HTTP requests/responses
2. **Business Logic Layer** (`service/`) - Contains business rules and logic
3. **Data Access Layer** (`repository/`) - Manages database operations
4. **Data Model Layer** (`model/`) - Defines data structures
5. **Configuration Layer** (`config/`) - Application configuration
6. **Exception Handling Layer** (`exception/`) - Error management

This structure provides:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and extend
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Simplicity**: Clean and focused codebase

## Database Schema

The application uses a simple `expenses` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE expenses (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    description VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    expense_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

## Starting Fresh

The application starts with a completely empty database. You can:
- Add your own expenses through the web interface
- Use the H2 console to inspect the database structure
- Test all CRUD operations with your own data

This is a clean, simple expense tracker perfect for learning Spring Boot concepts and basic web development! 

## Running with Docker

You can build and run the application in a Docker container:

1. **Build the Docker image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t expense-tracker .
   ```
2. **Run the Docker container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 expense-tracker
   ```

- The app will be available at http://localhost:8080
- The H2 console will be available at http://localhost:8080/h2-console
